## **Risk Details and Mitigation Plans**

### **R001: Low User Adoption**
- **Description:** Users may find the platform difficult to use or may not see its value.
- **Mitigation Plan:**
  - Provide clear and concise training materials.
  - Actively seek user feedback and implement necessary improvements.
  - Conduct webinars or workshops to demonstrate the platform's benefits.

### **R002: Delays in MVP Delivery**
- **Description:** Development may be delayed due to unforeseen blockers or resource constraints.
- **Mitigation Plan:**
  - Add a buffer period to the project timeline.
  - Conduct sprint retrospectives to identify and resolve issues early.

### **R003: Difficulty in Feature Prioritization**
- **Description:** Misalignment between stakeholders on feature importance may delay progress.
- **Mitigation Plan:**
  - Use MoSCoW prioritization to categorize features.
  - Engage all stakeholders during backlog grooming sessions.

### **R004: Security Vulnerabilities**
- **Description:** User authentication system may have potential security loopholes.
- **Mitigation Plan:**
  - Conduct regular penetration testing.
  - Use industry-standard authentication protocols (e.g., OAuth).

### **R005: Budget Overruns**
- **Description:** The project may exceed its allocated budget for tools and infrastructure.
- **Mitigation Plan:**
  - Monitor spending closely and identify cost-saving alternatives.
  - Reallocate resources as needed.

### **R006: Technical Challenges in Search Functionality**
- **Description:** Implementing an efficient search system may require more time and resources.
- **Mitigation Plan:**
  - Allocate additional time for R&D and testing.
  - Use proven search frameworks or libraries to minimize development effort.

### **R007: Lack of Engagement During Testing**
- **Description:** End-users may not actively participate in usability testing.
- **Mitigation Plan:**
  - Offer incentives (e.g., gift cards, recognition) for participation.
  - Schedule flexible testing sessions to accommodate users' schedules.

## **Risk Monitoring and Reporting**
- The Scrum Master will review and update the risk log during sprint retrospectives.
- All team members are encouraged to report new risks as they arise.
- A summary of risks and their status will be included in weekly project updates.
