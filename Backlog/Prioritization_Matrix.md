# Prioritization Matrix: Knowledge-Sharing Platform for Remote Teams

## **Overview**
This prioritization matrix categorizes backlog items based on their **impact** (value to users) and **effort** (resources and time required). It helps the team focus on high-value, low-effort tasks while effectively planning for more complex features.

## **Impact vs. Effort Matrix**

| **Quadrant**              | **Description**                                                                                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **High Impact, Low Effort** | Must-do items that deliver significant value with minimal effort. These should be prioritized first.                                           |
| **High Impact, High Effort** | Important features that require more resources. Plan these strategically to balance timelines and impact.                                      |
| **Low Impact, Low Effort**   | Nice-to-have features that can be considered after higher-priority items are addressed.                                                     |
| **Low Impact, High Effort**  | Avoid or deprioritize these tasks as they deliver little value relative to the resources required.                                             |

## **Backlog Prioritization Table**

| **Backlog Item**                  | **Impact** | **Effort** | **Priority Quadrant**      | **Action**                                 |
|-----------------------------------|------------|------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| US001: Account Creation           | High       | Low        | High Impact, Low Effort    | Prioritize for immediate implementation.   |
| US002: Secure Login               | High       | Low        | High Impact, Low Effort    | Prioritize for immediate implementation.   |
| US003: Document Upload            | High       | Medium     | High Impact, High Effort   | Include in initial MVP; plan resources.    |
| US004: Search Functionality       | High       | Medium     | High Impact, High Effort   | Include in early sprints; allocate time.   |
| US005: Tagging Documents          | Medium     | Low        | Low Impact, Low Effort     | Schedule for later development.            |
| US006: Q&A Forum                  | Medium     | High       | High Impact, High Effort   | Plan for post-MVP phase.                   |
| US007: Notifications              | Medium     | Medium     | Medium Priority            | Consider during sprint planning.           |
| US008: Password Reset             | High       | Low        | High Impact, Low Effort    | Prioritize for early development.          |
| US009: Admin Dashboard            | Medium     | High       | High Impact, High Effort   | Develop after core user features.          |
| US010: Onboarding Tutorials       | Low        | Medium     | Low Impact, Medium Effort  | Deprioritize until core features are done. |

## **Actions and Next Steps**
1. Implement all **High Impact, Low Effort** items (e.g., US001, US002, US008) in the first sprint.
2. Begin planning for **High Impact, High Effort** items (e.g., US003, US004) for MVP development.
3. Revisit **Low Impact** items (e.g., US005, US010) once core functionalities are completed.
4. Regularly update the matrix as new features or insights emerge during development.

By leveraging this prioritization matrix, the project team ensures efficient allocation of resources and timely delivery of features that offer the most value.
